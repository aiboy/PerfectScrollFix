PerfectScrollFix
================

PerfectScrollFix is a fork of ScrollFix (https://github.com/joelambert/ScrollFix) small script that partially works around the most common issue with using iOS5's overflow: scroll for fullscreen web apps.

The newly support `overflow:scroll` is a great addition and works well except under the following conditions:

- 	The scroll area is at the top and the user tries to scroll up.
- 	The scroll area is at the bottom and the user tries to scroll down.

In a native app, you'd expect the content to rubber band but in Safari the whole page is scrolled instead. Under occasions where you've deliberately hidden the browser chrome, this interaction can bring it back into view.

PerfectScrollFix have two main diffrences:

- 	It works like magic without a lot of work just mark scrollable elements with '.scrollable' class and call PerfectScrollFix.enable() and you done.
- 	It works prefectly stable.

# How to use

Setup a scrollable section by adding 'scrollable' class name (make sure that 'scrollable' element have only one element inside, a wrapper so to speek):

	<div class="scrollable">
		<ul>
			<li>List Item</li>
			<li>List Item</li>
			<li>List Item</li>
			<li>List Item</li>
			<li>List Item</li>
			<li>List Item</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

And script to the page header and then call the following code:

	PerfectScrollFix.enable();

Thats it! :)
